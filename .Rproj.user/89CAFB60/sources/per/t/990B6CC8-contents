```{r cars}

  instal.packages("pacman")

               tidyverse,

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r load data}
data<-readxl::read_excel(here("data/mentor_edited.xlsx"))
summary(data)
```


```{r cleaning data, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#####
#CHANGING THE VAIRABLES OF THE DATA

data1<-data %>% 
mutate(Age=as.integer(Age))#CHANGING AGE TO A NUMERICAL VAIRABLE
summary(data1)
data2<-data1 %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.character),as.factor))  #MUTATING ALL CATEGORICAL DATA INTO FACTORS
summary(data2)


#####
#CREATING AN AGE GROUP COLUMN
data3<-data2 %>% 
  mutate(`Age group`=case_when(Age>=10 & Age<=13 ~ "10-13",
                             Age>=14 & Age<=16 ~ "14-16"
                             ,TRUE~ "17-19")) %>% 
  select(`Age group`,everything())
summary(data3)

#####
#REMOVING COLUMS THAT ARENT NEEDED
data4<-data3 %>% 
select(!c("start","end","Specify others","Do you use any aids or tools during BSE/Option 5","Do you have a at history of breast cancer","At what age should you start performing","Do you think BSE is a private matter that should not be discussed openly","Do you think BSE is time consuming or inconvenient","Do you believe that BSE can help prevent breast cancer","Ethnic group")) %>% 
  mutate(`Age group`=as.factor(`Age group`))
summary(data4)
```

```{r demographic data}
demo_data<-data4 %>% 
  select("Age group","School","Sex","Religion","Residence","What is your class","Do you have any disability","Do you have any family history of breast cancer")  






```





























Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
